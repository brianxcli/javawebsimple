# javawebsimple Question Review
## 1. Frameworks used for the front-end and back-end
For this little task, I used Struts2 for the front-end and JSP for the back-end.
The very direct reason is that I used to work under these two frameworks at my company in China and I am confident to build up a project very fast.
Given more time, I am able to transfer the code to frameworks like Spring and Angular/React. And then, the front and back ends communicate using JSON strings, which is more liked recently. 
Additionally, I used Tomcat as my server application. It's free and popular in the industry. But it's not that efficient when serving millions of users. Nginx could be used to balance the load.

## 2. How the persistent layer could be implemented?
MySQL is commonly used, and the JSP framework is convenient to connect to MySQL using .xml configuration file. In the server.xml file of Tomcat, tags called <Connector> is used to connect databases.

## 3. Time I took to finish the project
1> Development platform building: 1 hour including technical selection, tools downloading, project creation, reading documents;
2> Review syntax of frameworks: 2 hours;
3> Coding & Debugging: 1.5 hours;
4> Writing the report: 0.5 hours
